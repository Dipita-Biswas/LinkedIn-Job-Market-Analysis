# LinkedIn-Job-Market-Analysis
Analysis of LinkedIn job postings (2023‚Äì24) to identify top roles, skills, and locations for analytics grads.

With thousands of roles listed every week, LinkedIn offers a fascinating window into what the job market truly looks like. I wanted to dig deeper, especially from the perspective of someone starting out in Business Analytics. So I analyzed **26,519 LinkedIn job postings** from 2023‚Äì2024 (Dataset from Kaggle: LinkedIn Job Postings (2023 - 2024)) to uncover where the real opportunities lie:  
- Which roles are actually hiring?  
- What skills are most in demand?  
- Where should recent graduates focus their time?

This project brings together data analysis in Python, interactive dashboards in Tableau, and a clear visual presentation to make sense of it all.

## Purpose

I created this project to get clarity on what the LinkedIn job market actually looks like for someone with a Business Analytics background. Instead of guessing which roles or locations were best, I used data to answer:

- Which industries have the highest job concentration?
- Where are the top job locations?
- What job titles are hiring and how much do they pay?
- How much experience is actually required?
- What skills should I focus on learning?

The result is a clear, data-backed view of the job landscape ‚Äî helpful for anyone trying to break into analytics, product, strategy, or related roles.
